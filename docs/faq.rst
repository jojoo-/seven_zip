Questions, someone might ask. Or not.

Why not use py-lzma?
---------------------
7zip is more than lzma. 7zip implements the CPU and space efficent lzma Algorithm, but it is also a powerful unpacker for nearly every file you can think of. Unpack an .deb? No problemo. exe's? Unpack .flv's so you have a video and a audio stream? 7zip is your friend!

Why didn't you use the 7zip SDK?

A: Because i'm not clever enough to do that. Yet.
